# LFE-Upgraded-Arduino

An upgraded control system for the Lyman Filament Extruder, using an Arduino microcontroller. This system integrates a stepper motor and a magnetic hall sensor to enable precise filament flow rate sensing and smart extrusion control.

## Features

- 🔁 **Closed-loop Flow Control** – Monitors and adjusts flow rate in real time using a magnetic hall sensor.
- 🎛️ **Stepper Motor Integration** – Provides consistent, controllable drive for the extrusion mechanism.
- 📟 **Arduino-Based** – Easily customizable with open-source Arduino code.
- ⚙️ **Modular Design** – Designed for integration into existing Lyman-style filament extruder hardware.

## Goals

- Improve filament diameter consistency.
- Enable feedback-based smart extrusion.
- Allow fine-grain motor control through code or UI.

## Getting Started

Coming soon: wiring diagrams, sample Arduino code, and calibration instructions.
